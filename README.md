# mvvm-todo-list App

_A simple todo-list-app built with **android architecture components** &  **mvvm architecture**._

## Features:
- search todos (filter todo-list items)
- sort list items (by_name & by_date_created).
- mark items as completed.
- mark item as important (! increases item priority, appears on top of list).
- show/hide completed todos.
- delete items.
- Add new items.


## Libraries & architecture used:
- 100% Kotlin.
- Room (SQLite).
- Jetpack DataStore :- store key/value pairs (small pieces of data e.g settings & preferences).
- Flow (Coroutines).
- Navigation Component.
- Dependency injection (Dagger Hilt).
- View Binding.
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) - app architecture.
- ViewModel + LiveData


## Advantages of a good app Architecture:
- separation of concerns: every component has its own responsibility.
- easier to maintain & add more features to the app.
